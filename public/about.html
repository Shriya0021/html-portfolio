<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Shriya Gopinath. I was born on 21st March 2006. I am from Palakkad, Kerala but presently I live in Coimbatore,Tamil Nadu.
    I scored 97.8% in class 10th and 96.6% in class 12. It was(and still is:)) my dream to study in an IIT, but I couldn't make it even after dropping a year.
    Right now, I am studying electrical and computer engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.
